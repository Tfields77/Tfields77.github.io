Conducted a 24-hour EDA on the Titanic dataset, addressing missing values and uncovering key insights into passenger demographics and survival rates. Used chi-square tests and visualizations to reveal significant relationships between passenger class, cabin information, and survival outcomes, and performed hypothesis testing to analyze age-related survival differences.

The "Cinema Chronicles" document was my Phase 2 project, focusing on data analysis and visualization in cinema. It involved using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean and analyze movie-related datasets. The project included natural language processing techniques to search for specific actors or directors within the data. Overall, it demonstrated my ability to integrate, transform, and visualize complex datasets effectively.

### Data-Driven EDA The Streaming Wars

In my first EDA, I analyzed Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video from 2009 to 2022. I found that Prime Video has the largest movie library and explored each platform's unique strategies for subscription growth. I also discovered that high-quality content doesn't always lead to higher revenue.
